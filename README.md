# Anti-Missile-Modeling

This project came up as an idea from a simpler problem which was proposed in Fluid Mechanics.
It consisted of an Anti-Missile that aims for anotger cruise missile and tries to intercept it.
At first it was set out with constant thrust and no air resistance and of course in a 2D region,
i tried it harder by solving this problem at a 3D region and considering all the previous simplifications.
I also integrated the Tsiolkovski's rocket equation by its differencial form into the differential equations system.
By discretizing all the posible cases in which the Anti-Missile might catch the Cruise missile or not i get to some of the results showed here.
